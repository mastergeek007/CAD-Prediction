# CAD-Prediction-
>To minimize human effort in detection and prediction of coronary artery disease.
>To build a robust system for analysis.
>To design a machine learning model which includes KNN, Random forest, SVM for categorical classification as disease and no disease.
>To implement coronary artery disease analysis system using libraries such as pandas, numphy, matplot, seaborn, sklearn.
Data preprocessing and cleaning at initial stage,  later use the data to train ML model
